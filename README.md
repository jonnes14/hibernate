# 📝 Hibernate Practice Repository  

This repository contains Hibernate examples and practice programs for learning **Object Relational Mapping (ORM)** using Java.  

## 📂 Contents  

### 📌 Hibernate Basics  
- 📖 Introduction to ORM  
- 🏗️ Hibernate architecture and workflow  
- ⚙️ Configuration with `hibernate.cfg.xml`  
- 📝 Annotations: `@Entity`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue`, `@Table`, `@Column`  

✅ *Check commits for detailed examples and clarification on each topic.*  

### 🛠️ CRUD Operations  
- ➕ Create, 🔍 Read, ✏️ Update, ❌ Delete operations  
- 🗂️ Session and transaction management  
- 🏭 Working with `SessionFactory` and `Session`  

✅ *Check commits for CRUD operation examples and explanations.*  

### 🔗 Entity Relationships  
- 🔄 One-to-One mapping (`@OneToOne`)  
- ➡️ One-to-Many mapping (`@OneToMany`)  
- ⬅️ Many-to-One mapping (`@ManyToOne`)  
- 🔁 Many-to-Many mapping (`@ManyToMany`)  

✅ *Refer to commits for relationship mappings with working code.*  

### 🔎 Querying with Hibernate  
- 📝 HQL (Hibernate Query Language)  
- 🧩 Parameter binding in queries  
- 💻 Native SQL queries  

✅ *Check commit history for query examples and usage details.*  

### 📥 Fetching and Cascading  
- 🚀 Fetch types: `EAGER` and `LAZY`  
- 🔄 Cascade operations: `ALL`, `PERSIST`, `MERGE`, `REMOVE`  

✅ *See commits for examples on fetching strategies and cascade types.*  

### ⚠️ Common Issues Handled  
- ❗ `LazyInitializationException`  
- 🗂️ Session management issues  
- ❓ Query execution problems  

✅ *Check commits for how common issues were fixed with explanations.*  

## 🚀 How to Run  

1. 🛠️ Add required Hibernate dependencies in `pom.xml`  
2. ⚙️ Configure database connection in `hibernate.cfg.xml`  
3. 📝 Write entity classes with annotations  
4. ▶️ Use `main()` methods to test operations  

## 🛠️ Tools Used  

- ☕ Java  
- 🔗 Hibernate ORM  
- 🗄️ MySQL / PostgreSQL / Any RDBMS  
- 🐘 Maven for dependency management
